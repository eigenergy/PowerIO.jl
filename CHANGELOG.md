## 0.1.1

Pointer lifetime hardening, backported from the ABI v4 branch; still targets
powerio C ABI version 3 (powerio v0.2.x binaries are drop in). No signature
changes; the one behavioral change is `finalize` on a zero-copy table, below.

- Use after free: every helper that lowers a `NetworkHandle` to a raw pointer
  now runs its ccalls under `GC.@preserve` — Julia may collect a handle after
  its last use, not at end of call, so a GC between pointer extraction and a
  ccall could finalize the handle and hand Rust a freed pointer (reachable in
  ordinary code such as `to_dense(parse_file(path))`). `_cstr` gains the same
  guard for its message buffers.
- Zero-copy `to_arrow(...; copy=false)` columns are `ArrowColumn`s that root
  the shared producer buffers (`ArrowBuffers`), so a column extracted from its
  `ArrowTable` stays valid on its own; previously it dangled once the table
  was collected. `close(t)` releases the buffers eagerly; `finalize(t)` is now
  a no-op (the owner frees once the table and every column drop).
- The handle finalizer captures `pio_network_free` from the library that
  allocated the network, so a `set_library!` swap can no longer free across
  allocators; `set_library!` also resets the ABI handshake.
- `read_gridfm_scenarios` verifies the scenario count between probe and fill
  (the directory can change under us; a short fill left heap garbage in the
  tail). Feature-gate errors rethrow non-toolchain exceptions instead of
  blaming the build.
- Per-call warning buffers grow to 4096 bytes and a fill near the cap is
  surfaced as a truncation marker instead of silently dropping warnings.

## 0.1.0

- `read_gridfm` / `read_gridfm_scenarios` read a gridfm-datakit Parquet dataset
  back into a `Network` — the inverse of the gridfm writer, the ML→classical
  return leg (lossy but power-flow-complete; what the schema can't round-trip
  comes back in `warnings`). Needs powerio-capi built `--features gridfm`;
  `gridfm_available()` probes for the symbol (no ABI bump, still version 3).

## 0.0.1

First release, targeting powerio C ABI version 3.

- `parse_file` / `parse_str` / `from_json` → `Network`, with accessors over
  the lossless JSON transport.
- `to_dense` for numeric tables as typed arrays, `to_arrow` for Arrow C Data
  Interface export (owned columns by default, zero copy behind `copy=false`),
  `to_normalized`, `to_matpower`, `to_format`, `convert_file`.
- Bridges: `to_powermodels` / `from_powermodels`, `to_powerdata` /
  `parse_ac_power_data` for ExaPowerIO/ExaModelsPower.
- Binary distribution via lazy artifacts built from tagged powerio releases;
  ABI version handshake at first use; sibling checkout auto-discovery for
  development.
